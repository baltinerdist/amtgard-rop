Full profile (requirements, how it ends, properties, what stops it, similar abilities, every rule sentence): [`metadata/profiles/toxic-blades.md`](../../metadata/profiles/toxic-blades.md).

## Where it is listed

| Class | Level | Cost | Max | Frequency | Range here | Magical | Listed in | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Druid](../classes/druid.md) | 6th | 1 | - | 1/Refresh | Other | yes | Spell table | - |

## Effect on each class

Assumes every class is 6th level. Results do not depend on level.

| Target class | Result | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Anti-Paladin](../classes/anti-paladin.md) | Works |  |
| [Archer](../classes/archer.md) | Works |  |
| [Assassin](../classes/assassin.md) | Works |  |
| [Barbarian](../classes/barbarian.md) | Works |  |
| [Monk](../classes/monk.md) | Works |  |
| [Paladin](../classes/paladin.md) | Works | Enchantments apply despite Immunity (Enchantments rule 3) |
| [Scout](../classes/scout.md) | Works |  |
| [Warrior](../classes/warrior.md) | Works |  |
| [Bard](../classes/bard.md) | Works |  |
| [Druid](../classes/druid.md) | Works |  |
| [Healer](../classes/healer.md) | Works |  |
| [Wizard](../classes/wizard.md) | Works |  |

Touch and Other range also need the target to be willing, dead, stunned, frozen or Insubstantial and unable to move. That applies to every class alike and is not modelled.

## Connected abilities

No other ability's text names it, and it names no other ability.

## If you change its level

- Who it works on does not change with level: class Immunities are 1st-level Traits, and Enlightened Soul is a 1st-level Monk Trait.
- What can change: which classes can use it at a given level, what it competes with at that level, and any archetype or ability that depends on it (see above).

- **Druid** lists it at 6th for 1 point. That level's table has 8 entries (11 points if each were bought once, including 0 Equipment traits and 3 Archetypes). A Magic User has five points per level, and unused points roll down to lower levels, not up (see the README).
